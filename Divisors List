# Question : Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 2 is a divisor of 24 because 24 / 2 has no remainder.)
# My Solution :

number = int(input("Please type your number :"))
listRange = list(range(1, number+1))
divisorList = []
for natural_number in listRange:
    if number % natural_number == 0:
        divisorList.append(natural_number)
        
print (divisorList)
